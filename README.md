# Dumb_Dump Bulletin Board
## UPDATES
  - Trying out OpenGL as been yearning for 3D projects from scratch since history
  - Focused with GDScript for a long time now so I gotta review these stuff again xD
  - Spacebar sucks, and the version right here isn't even close to the current one, dunno when will update
  - comsole.py contents:
    - [x] addition
    - [x] subtraction
    - [x] multiplication
    - [x] division
    - [x] power
    - [x] square root
    - [x] summation
    - [x] factorial
    - [x] comparison
  - Updated comsole.c and added comsole.py that performs auto-summation up to the value of the inputted number.
  - Just made another program with C, specifically the 'comsole.c'; I'm glad I practiced and
  learned recursions! - 10/08/2020, 1:08 PM
  - After a hiatus I'm back! I just reviewed the basics of Python and I learned C as well!
  Overall, the C seems to be a bridge between Python and C++ xD - 10/07/2020, 9:11 PM
  - I haven't slept a daw since the time, 09/07-08/2020, when I made myBot_beta.py
  QwQ I am going to be a ghost literally
  - name_recorder.java is as what its name says; I consider this as my first
  'real' Java experience, not one with school smh skskskksk; overall, Java
  is fun to experiment with too xD - 09/12/2020, 9 PM
  - cpp_Test_1-4.py is just chad Test_1-4.cpp with lesser lines of code,
  and it obviously needs to be written in same language just to be fair
  (I'm still lazy to do it I'll take a break) - 09/06/2020, 1:24 AM
