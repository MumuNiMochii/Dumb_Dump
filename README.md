# Dumb_Dump Bulletin Board
## Questions I QA-ed.
### What is 'Dumb_Dump'?
My own repository of mostly simple and sometimes absurd works and ideas of programs
written in Python 3.6. Well, originally I had thought of it that way, but now I've decided
that my other projects written in other languages will be included here.
### What is 'Dumb_Dump Bulletin Board'?
This 'Dumb_Dump Bulletin Board' serves as the bulletin board of the repository;
meaning that further updates and notes will be written here.
### What are included within the Dumb_Dump repository?
The other works in terms of 'ideas' include my 'Python_Basics' repository,
where the works there are 'test sites'. That also include the 'CPlusPlus_Basics'
repository.
Aside from my legitimate works this includes:
  - modified examples from the Internet
### More Info:
  - cpp_Test_1-4.py is just chad Test_1-4.cpp with lesser lines of code,
  and it obviously needs to be written in same language just to be fair

  - name_recorder.java is as what its name says; I consider this as my first
  'real' Java experience, not one with school smh skskskksk; overall, Java
  is fun to experiment with too xD
