# Dumb_Dump Bulletin Board
## Questions I QA-ed.
### What is 'Dumb_Dump'?
My own repository of mostly simple and sometimes absurd works and ideas of programs
written in Python 3.6. Well, originally I had thought of it that way, but now I've decided
that my other projects written in other languages will be included here.
### What is 'Dumb_Dump Bulletin Board'?
This 'Dumb_Dump Bulletin Board' serves as the bulletin board of the repository;
meaning that further updates and notes will be written here.
### What are included within the Dumb_Dump repository?
The other works in terms of 'ideas' include my 'Python_Basics' repository,
where the works there are 'test sites'. That also include the 'CPlusPlus_Basics'
repository.
Aside from my legitimate works this includes:
  - modified examples from the Internet
### What are the programming languages involved?
  - C
  - C++
  - Java
  - Python
  - HTML
    - Yeah I know it ain't a pro-lang and is a markup language instead, but hey
    it got scripts and all of that stuff xD
### Updates
  - Just made another program with C, specifically the 'comsole.c'; I'm glad I practiced and
  learned recursions! - 10/08/2020, 1:08 PM
  - After a hiatus I'm back! I just reviewed the basics of Python and I learned C as well!
  Overall, the C seems to be a bridge between Python and C++ xD - 10/07/2020, 9:11 PM
  - I haven't slept a daw since the time, 09/07-08/2020, when I made myBot_beta.py
  QwQ I am going to be a ghost literally
  - name_recorder.java is as what its name says; I consider this as my first
  'real' Java experience, not one with school smh skskskksk; overall, Java
  is fun to experiment with too xD - 09/12/2020, 9 PM
  - cpp_Test_1-4.py is just chad Test_1-4.cpp with lesser lines of code,
  and it obviously needs to be written in same language just to be fair
  (I'm still lazy to do it I'll take a break) - 09/06/2020, 1:24 AM
